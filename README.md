# Linked Lists (in Rust)
This is a collection of Linked List implementations in Rust.

## Background
12PM, April 7th, 2022. It's nearing the finals prep season, and I decided that it would be a good idea to implement Linked Lists in Rust. 

I'm not the biggest fan of Linked Lists. Imo there are many better alternatives in Rust (at least for the things I do/am familiar with). But I had some time to ~~procrastinate~~ kill and haven't touched Rust since I started college.
